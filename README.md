# utilities
A handful of utility scripts I made a couple years ago and have used periodically.

# Controller
This script is meant to read names of python scripts from a .txt file, launch then, monitor their progress, and relaunch them in case of a crash.

# FTP Sync
A robust script that monitors files between local directories and an FTP server, uploading changed files to the FTP server.

# Mail Checker
Modifies the background color and title of a .html file I have open in a browser as an additional notification in case I get a new email and miss the initial notification, which tends to happen.

# Print xlsx
A few quick methods of printing data from .xslx files.  Being able to see the output from all three allows for one to easily be chosen and adapted into another script that needs to read .xlsx files.

# Rename Directories
Being a fan of Lupas Rename 2000, which seems to only work on files and not directories, I created a simple script to fairly safely batch rename directories.
